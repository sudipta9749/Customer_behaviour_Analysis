Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis1. Project OverviewThis project performs a comprehensive analysis of a customer shopping dataset to uncover insights into purchasing patterns, product preferences, and customer segmentation. The primary objective is to identify key trends and provide actionable, data-driven recommendations to guide strategic business decisions in marketing, sales, and customer retention.2. DatasetThe dataset consists of 3,900 transaction records with 18 features, including:Customer Demographics: Age, Gender, LocationPurchase Details: Item Purchased, Category, Purchase Amount (USD), SeasonBehavioral Metrics: Review Rating, Subscription Status, Shipping Type, Frequency of Purchases3. Tools & TechnologiesData Cleaning & EDA: Python (Pandas, NumPy)Database: MySQLData Visualization & Dashboard: Power BIPresentation: Gamma4. Project StepsData Loading & Cleaning (Python):Loaded the shopping_behavior.csv dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.Standardized column names (e.g., Purchase Amount (USD) to purchase_amount_usd).Handled missing values by imputing the median for the review_rating column.Checked for and managed duplicate entries.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (Python):Performed initial analysis using .info() and .describe() to understand data structure and statistics.Analyzed distributions of key numerical and categorical features.Database & SQL Analysis (MySQL):Loaded the cleaned DataFrame into a MySQL database (customer_db) for analysis.Executed SQL queries to answer specific business questions, such as:Total revenue by gender and age group.Top 5 most popular products.Average purchase amount for subscribers vs. non-subscribers.Purchase frequency by customer segment.Dashboard Development (Power BI):Connected Power BI to the MySQL database.Designed and built an interactive dashboard to visualize key findings and KPIs.Reporting & Presentation (Report & Gamma):Compiled all insights, visualizations, and recommendations into a formal written report.Created a high-level summary presentation using Gamma to communicate the project's story and business value to stakeholders.5. Power BI DashboardThe interactive dashboard provides a consolidated view of customer behavior. Key features include:KPI Cards: Total Customers (3.9K), Average Purchase Amount ($59.76), and Average Review Rating (3.75).Key Visuals:% of Customers by Subscription Status (Donut Chart)Revenue by Category and Sales by Category (Bar Charts)Revenue by Age Group (Bar Chart)Interactivity: Slicers to filter the entire report by Subscription Status, Gender, Category, and Shipping Type.6. Key Results & RecommendationsResult: Non-subscribers make up 73% of the customer base but have a nearly identical average spend ($59.87) to subscribers ($59.49).Recommendation: Launch a targeted marketing campaign to highlight exclusive subscriber benefits (e.g., free shipping, early access) to convert this large, high-value segment.Result: Male customers generated significantly more revenue (~$158K) than female customers (~$75K) in this dataset.Recommendation: Investigate product assortment and marketing to ensure equal appeal, or double-down on marketing to the male demographic if this aligns with business goals.Result: Young Adults (18-30) and Middle-Aged (31-45) are the highest-revenue-generating age groups.Recommendation: Focus marketing efforts and ad spend on platforms frequented by these high-value demographics.7. How to RunClone Repository:git clone [https://github.com/sudipta9749/Customer_behaviour_Analysis.git](https://github.com/sudipta9749/Customer_behaviour_Analysis.git)
cd customer-analytics
Python Environment:Install the required Python libraries:pip install pandas numpy sqlalchemy pymysql
Database Setup (MySQL):Ensure you have a MySQL server running.Create a new database (e.g., customer_db).Update the database connection string in the Python script (load_to_mysql.py).Run Scripts:Execute the Python script to perform cleaning and load the data into MySQL.python load_to_mysql.py
Power BI:Open the Customer_Behavior_Dashboard.pbix file.You may need to update the data source credentials to connect to your local MySQL database.View Reports:The final written Project_Report.pdf and a link to the Gamma presentation are included in the /reports folder.# Customer_behaviour_Analysis
